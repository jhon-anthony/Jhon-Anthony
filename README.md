## Projects

### Holgu√≠n Tourist Observatory

**Summary:**
Tourism in recent years has been impacted by several factors, with the COVID-19 pandemic being one of the most significant. Following the pandemic, the Holgu√≠n Tourist Observatory was created in the province of Holgu√≠n to boost tourism in the destination and take advantage of emerging opportunities. However, the lack of an information management system for this entity has hindered planning and strategic decision-making.

This work focuses on creating an information management system for the Tourist Observatory, allowing the organization and analysis of data related to the facilities of different poles and the tourist indicators evaluated. The system will offer an integral solution to manage the information of different indicators, facilitating the transmission and processing of information. The proposed system will enable informed decision-making, supporting the revitalization of tourism in Holgu√≠n. With the implementation of this system, it is expected to improve the Observatory's capacity to optimize sustainable tourism development and strengthen the destination's competitiveness.

**Technologies Used:**
- Nuxt3
- Express (Node.js)
- Sequelize
